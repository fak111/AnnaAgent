The code for the paper `AnnaAgent: Dynamic Evolution Agent Systerm with Multi-Session Memory for Realistic Seeker Simulation`.

It is important to note that since this work involves data from counselling records of real patients with psychological disorders, the publicly available code can only be used to demonstrate part of the methodology. The data and the code directly related to the data will not be made public until further ethical review and processing. Please contact the authors if needed.

Due to the fact that real user data is involved, we are unable to open source the main document until further privacy and ethical reviews are completed. To make it easier for readers to learn how to use it, we add the flowchart below:
